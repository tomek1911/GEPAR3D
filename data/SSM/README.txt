Required SSM models come from:
Kim, HH., Choi, S., Chang, YI. et al. 
Developing a three-dimensional statistical shape model of normal dentition using an automated algorithm and normal samples. 
Clin Oral Invest 27, 759â€“772 (2023). 
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-022-04824-z

To reproduce, one need to use ssm model from Figure 6 and Figure 7 for statisical female and male dentition.
If you found SSM useful remember to cite Kim et al. work.
